#### No need to set a defined height on the map container!

Before using Leaflet you had to have a hardcoded height valve in order for the map to render, as seen below:

>Make sure the map container has a defined height, for example by setting it in CSS:
>```css
>#mapid { height: 180px; }
>```

Now you can use percents and the map will still render.

>```css
>#mapid { height: 100%; }
>```

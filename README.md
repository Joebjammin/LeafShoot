#### No need to set a defined height on the map container!

Before using Leaflet you had to have a hard-coded height value in order for the map to render, as seen below:

>Make sure the map container has a defined height, for example by setting it in CSS:
>```css
>#mapid { height: 180px; }
>```

Now you can use percentages and the map will render!

>```css
>#mapid { height: 100%; }
>```

## Other

* Why is it called LeafShoot?
> Desired a name that encapsulates both Leaflet and BootStrap in one. 
> A leaf shoot in reality is the bud of a tea leaf before it opens from its natural curled up form, which makes a good fit for the name.
